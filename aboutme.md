![Bio](/assets/img/about.png "Bio") Hi, I am Muhammad Afzal - actively engaged in _applied research_ covering _Plant Breeding / Quantitative Genetics / Biostatistics / GWAS / Genomic Selection / Proteomics_. I love to teach/learn and share my know-how. That is one of the fundamental reasons to build this website. I will be writing/speaking about R for Data Science, statistics using R, Quick fixes to R-related issues, Scientific Productivity, Quantitative Genetics and Plant Breeding.

![Current Work](/assets/img/job.png "Current Work") Currently I am focused to _genetically characterize the proteomes_ of spelt and bread wheat in order to facilitate future plant breeding. Additionally, I am _leading two projects_ - one to produce improved Emmer varieties and the other aimed at association mapping and evaluation of various traits of Einkorn. Besides all this and that, I am a _die hard cricket player_ and a _poet_.
