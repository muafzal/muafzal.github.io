![Bio](/assets/img/about.png) Hi, I am Muhammad Afzal - actively engaged in _applied research_ covering _Plant Breeding / Quantitative Genetics / Biostatistics / GWAS / Genomic Selection / Proteomics_. I love to teach and share my my know-how. That is the fundamental reason to build this website.

![Passion](/assets/img/passion.png) Data Science, Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Plant Breeding, Genomics

![Current Work](/assets/img/job.png) Currently I am focused to _genetically characterize the proteomes_ of spelt and bread wheat in order to facilitate future plant breeding. Additionally, I am _leading two projects_ - one to produce improved Emmer varieties and the other aimed at association mapping and evaluation of various traits in Einkorn. Besides all this and that, I am a _die hard cricket player_ and a _poet_.
