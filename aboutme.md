![Bio](/assets/img/about.png) Hi, I am Muhammad Afzal - experienced in _Applied research / Plant Breeding / Quantitative Genetics / Biostatistics / GWAS / Genomic Selection / Proteomics_. I aspire to implement my skills for the betterment of science and society.

![Passion](/assets/img/passion.png) I love to explore new avenues in data science and learn every day something new.

![Current Work](/assets/img/job.png) Currently, I am working as _graduate research assistant / PhD candidate_. The focus of my research is to _genetically characterize the proteomes_ of spelt and bread wheat in order to facilitate future plant breeding. Additionally, I am _leading two projects_ - one to produce improved Emmer varieties and the other aimed at association mapping and evaluation of various traits in Einkorn. Besides all this and that, I am a _die hard cricket player_, a _poet_ and a _data science enthusiast_.

![Education](/assets/img/education.png) It has been a priviledge to get two master degrees - one in Environmental Sciences and the other in Plant Breeding and Seed Science.

![Tools](/assets/img/tools.png) Among some useful tools that I know include **R**, **SQL**, **MS Office**, **Python (learning)**. I am pretty comfortable with performing GWAS, Genomic Selection, Analyzing high-throughput/omics data, writing/reviewing manuscripts and conducting extensive field trials.
