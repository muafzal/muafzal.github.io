![Current Work](/assets/img/job.png "Current Work") Since Nov 2018, I have been working to _study the the proteomes_ of different wheat species in order to facilitate future plant breeding for producing nutritionally better varieties. In addition, I have been _leading two projects_ - aimed at producing improved varieties, performing association mapping and evaluating around 100 traits related to quality and agronomic attributes of Emmer and Einkorn wheat.
