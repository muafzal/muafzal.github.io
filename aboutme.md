![Bio](/assets/img/about.png) Hi, I am Muhammad Afzal and go as Muhammad. It has been a great journey to gather experience about diverse facets of business and research domains. I have worked in the seed/agrochemical business, applied research and practical plant breeding sectors. My passion to contribute to science and society is the driving force for me.

![Passion](/assets/img/passion.png) I love to explore new avenues in data science, learn every day and amazed by the combined power of Statistics, Biology and omics.

![Current Work](/assets/img/job.png) Currently, I am working as graduate research assistant / PhD candidate. The focus of my research is to genetically characterize the proteomes of spelt and bread wheat in order to facilitate future plant breeding. At the same time, I am leading two projects - one to produce improved Emmer varieties and the other aimed at association mapping and evaluation of various traits in Einkorn. Besides all this and that, I am a die hard cricket player, a poet and a data science enthusiast.

![Education](/assets/img/education.png) It has been a priviledge to get two master degrees - one in Environmental Sciences, the other in Plant Breeding and Seed Science.

![Tools](/assets/img/tools.png) Among some useful tools that I know include R, SQL, MS Office, Python (learning). I am comfortable with performing GWAS, Genomic Selection, Analyzing high-throughput/big data, writing/reviewing manuscripts and conducting extensive field trials.
