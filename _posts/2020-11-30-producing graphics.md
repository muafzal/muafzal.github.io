This post will show you how to create high quality graphics ready for publications in high-impact journals.

## Highlights

    1. Prepare input data
    2. Make and save plot. Should your figure have only one panel, stop here - your figure is ready to be used for your manuscript

    4. Assemble multiple panels into one figure in Inkscape
    5. Export as vector graphics or png
