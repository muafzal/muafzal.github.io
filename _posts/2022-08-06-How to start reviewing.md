In this short post, we will comprehensively talk about some key considerations when you like to start with reviewing research papers.

Reviewing research papers is an important part of the scientific process and can be a valuable way for young scientists to gain experience and improve their skills. Here are a few steps you can follow to get started with reviewing research papers:

1. Familiarize yourself with the journal's guidelines: Each journal has its own guidelines for reviewing papers. Make sure you understand these guidelines and follow them carefully. Choose one or more journals that you like the most.

2. Understand the scope of the paper: Before you begin your review, make sure you understand the purpose and scope of the paper. This will help you to evaluate whether the paper is relevant to your own research and whether it makes a significant contribution to the field.

3. Read the paper carefully: Take your time to read the paper carefully, making sure you understand all the concepts and methods presented. Pay particular attention to the introduction, which should provide an overview of the paper's objectives and the research question being addressed.

4. Identify strengths and weaknesses: As you read the paper, consider its strengths and weaknesses. What are the main contributions of the paper? Are the methods used appropriate and well-described? Is the data presented clearly and accurately?

5. Offer constructive feedback: When writing your review, aim to provide constructive feedback that will help the authors improve their paper. Be specific and provide examples to support your comments. Remember, providing feedback withouth a reference to the specific part in the manuscript will make it hard for the authors to understand what you want to change. Avoid vague critics. Instead be specific and objective.

6. Follow the journal's guidelines: Follow the journal's guidelines for formatting and submitting your review. Make sure you adhere to the word limit and provide a clear and concise review.

7. Stay unbiased: No matter what situation, you MUST stay unbiased when providing your feedback. This is moral responsibility and good scientific practice. Consider yourself in the position of the authors.

8. Gaining experience: Request your supervisor to provide you the opportunities to review his research papers or project reports. Doing such reviews will give you confidence and experience. You can ask them for their feedback on your review.

By following these steps, you can begin to develop your skills as a reviewer and contribute to the scientific community. You can mention your reviewing records in your resume to showcase your services for the scientific community.
